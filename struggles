done:


heroku couldn't build with latest (16.7.0) react/react-dom/react-redux versions,
had to experimentally find which closest previous version works

todos:
 - this file structure is very basic, I prefer splitting things by components,
not just "all components in one folder", this setup may be okay for this small project
 - more abstractions, those weekly/hourly presentation components may be unified more
 - better fitment for narrow screens (mobile)
 - better URL handling for /:some/:thing/:else cases
